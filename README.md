# EvaHan-GujiRoBERTa-NER

This repository contains my submission and extended experiments for the **EvaHan2025** Classical Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.  
The goal of this project is to build a domain-adapted NER system for classical and medical Chinese texts using the GujiRoBERTa language model.

## üß† Project Overview

**Task**: Named Entity Recognition for Classical Chinese  
**Entities Covered**: Person (PER), Location (LOC), Time (TIME)  
**Model**: Fine-tuned `GujiRoBERTa` with CRF decoding and knowledge-enhanced training

## üìä Evaluation Results

| Dataset    | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Dev Set    | 85.3%     | 84.0%  | **84.6%** |
| Test Set A | 83.1%     | 82.4%  | **82.7%** |

The model achieves competitive results on both internal validation and the official test set of EvaHan2025.
